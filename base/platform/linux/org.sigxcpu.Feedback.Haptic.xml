       @short_description: Interface to make a device vibrate

       This D-Bus interface is used to make a device's haptic motor
       vibrate. This is can be useful e.g. for games.

       To provider user feedback the event based interface should be
       preferred.

        Vibrate:
        @app_id: The application id usually in "reverse DNS" format
        @pattern: The vibration pattern.
        @success: Whether vibration was triggered

        Triggers the given vibration pattern on the haptic device. The
        pattern is a sequence of relative amplitude and duration pairs.
        The amplitude must be between 0.0 and 1.0.
